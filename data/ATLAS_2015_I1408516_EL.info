Description:
  Distributions of transverse momentum $p_\text{T}^{\ell\ell}$ and the angular variable $\phi^\ast_\eta$ of Drell-Yan lepton pairs
  are measured in $20.3\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$\,TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
  Measurements in electron-pair and muon-pair final states are corrected for detector effects. Compared to previous measurements
  in proto--proton collisions at i$\sqrt{s}=7$\,TeV, these new measurements benefit from a larger data sample and improved control
  of systematic uncertainties. Measurements are performed in bins of lepton-pair mass above, around and below the $Z$-boson mass peak.
  Specify the lepton channel (default is Z->ee) by using the dedicated plugins ATLAS_2015_I1408516_EL and ATLAS_2015_I1408516_MU.
